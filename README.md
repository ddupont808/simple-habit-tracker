### How to use

Each dot represents a day, with opaque dots being current and previous days while faded dots are days in the future. Click the dot if you did the one thing you were supposed to do on that day.

If you fail to do so, you will be greeted by an understandably dissapointed emoji the next time you open a new tab.
